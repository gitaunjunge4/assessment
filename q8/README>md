Write a function solution that, given a string S of length N, returns any palindrome which can be obtained by replacing all of the question marks in S by lowercase letters ('a'âˆ’'z'). If no palindrome can be obtained, the function should return the string "NO".
A palindrome is a string that reads the same both forwards and backwards. Some examples of palindromes are: "kayak", "radar", "mom".
Examples:
1. Given S = "?ab??a", the function should return "aabbaa".
2. Given S = "bab??a", the function should return "NO".
3. Given S = "?a?", the function may return "aaa". It may also return "zaz", among other possible answers.

input has ? that need to replace with a letter 'a'-'z'

change the input to a list and also get the length
init two pointers that will help you move from L-> R and R->L  L=0, R= Length -1
iterate though the string from outer to inner as you moe towards the centre checking if:
 - both ends have ? replace with a for easiest palindrome
 - L has letter and R has no letter; set value of R = to L
 - R has letter and L has no letter; set value of L = to R
 - L != R print statement 'NO'

if the len statement is odd and the middle value is ? set 'a' as the letter

return as string
